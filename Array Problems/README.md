## Array and Function Problems

1. Write a function called “getLastElement”.  Given an array, getLastElement returns the last element of the given array.

2. Write a function called “addToFront”.  Given an array and an element, “addToFront” adds the given element to the front of the given array, and returns the given array.  Note: it should be the SAME array, not a new array.

3. Write a function called “addToBack”.  Given an array and an element, “addToBack” returns the given array with the given element added to the end.  Note: it should be the SAME array, not a new array.

4. Write a function called “joinArrays”.  Given two arrays, “joinArrays” returns an array with the elements of “arr1" in order, followed by the elements in “arr2”.

5. Write a function called “getElementsAfter”.  Given an array and an index, “getElementsAfter” returns a new array with all the elements after (but not including) the given index.

6. Write a function called “getElementsUpTo”.  Given an array and a index, “getElementsUpTo”, returns an array with all the elements up until, but not including, the element at the given index.

7. Write a function called “getAllElementsButFirst”.  Given an array, “getAllElementsButFirst” returns an array with all the elements but the first.

8. Write a function called “getAllElementsButLast”.

9. Given an array, “getAllElementsButLast” returns an array with all the elements but the last.

10. Write a function called “removeFromFront”.  Given an array, “removeFromFront” returns the given array with its first element removed.

11. Write a function called “removeFromBack”.  Given an array, “removeFromBack” returns the given array with its last element removed.

12. Write a function called “removeFromBackOfNew”.  Given an array, “removeFromBackOfNew” returns a new array containing all but the last element of the given array.

13. Write a function called “removeFromFrontOfNew”.  Given an array, “removeFromFrontOfNew” returns a new array containing all but the first element of the given array.

14. Write a function called “countCharacter”.  Given a string input and a character, “countCharacter” returns the number of occurrences of a given character in the given string.

15. Write a function called “convertDoubleSpaceToSingle”.  Given a string, “convertDoubleSpaceToSingle” returns the passed in string, with all the double spaces converted to single spaces.

16. Write a function called “addToFrontOfNew”.  Given an array and an element, “addToFrontOfNew” returns a new array containing all the elements of the given array, with the given element added to the front.

17. Write a function called “addToBackNew”.  Given an array and an element, “addToBackNew”
